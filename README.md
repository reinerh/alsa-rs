Thin but safe wrappers for [ALSA](https://alsa-project.org).

[API Documentation](http://docs.rs/alsa)

[Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/alsa)

Expect the following to work:

 * Audio Playback

 * Audio Recording

 * Mixer controls

 * HCtl API (for jack detection)

 * Raw midi

 * Midi sequencer API (most of it)

 * Enumerations of all of the above

 * Poll and/or wait for all of the above

The following is not yet implemented (mostly because nobody asked for them) :

 * Separate timer API (snd_timer_*)

 * Config API (snd_config_*)

 * Plug-in API

Quickstart guide / API design:

 * Most functions map 1-to-1 to alsa-lib functions, e g, `ctl::CardInfo::get_id()` is a wrapper around
   `snd_ctl_card_info_get_id` and the [alsa-lib documentation](https://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/)
   can be consulted for additional information.

 * Structs are RAII and closed/freed on drop, e g, when a `PCM` struct is dropped, `snd_pcm_close` is called.

 * To read and write buffers, call the `io_*` methods. It will return a separate struct from which you can
   read or write, and which can also be used for mmap (if supported by the driver).

 * Error handling - most alsa-lib functions can return errors, so the return value from these is a `Result`.

 * Enumeration of cards, devices etc is done through structs implementing `Iterator`.

 * Many structs implement `Polldescriptors`, to combine with poll or mio. (Or just use `wait` if you don't need that functionality.)
